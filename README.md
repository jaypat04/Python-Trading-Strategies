## How the Bot Works:

### Market Monitoring:
The bot pulls the latest price data (OHLCV - open, high, low, close, volume) from Binance at regular intervals (e.g., every minute). It calculates two EMAs—the 50-period EMA (short-term) and 200-period EMA (long-term)—which serve as indicators of the market trend.

### Condition Checking (Signal Generation):
For a buy signal: The bot checks if the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA. This suggests a potential upward trend (bullish signal).
For a sell signal: The bot checks if the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA. This suggests a potential downward trend (bearish signal).
These signals are considered "crossover events" and are common indicators in trend-following strategies.

### Trade Execution:
Once the conditions are met, the bot executes an automatic buy or sell order on Binance.
For simplicity, this bot uses market orders (buying/selling at the current market price), which ensures that the order is filled immediately. However, market orders can result in higher costs due to slippage, especially in a fast-moving market.
